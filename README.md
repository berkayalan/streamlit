# Streamlit

Streamlit is an open-source Python library that makes it easy to create and share beautiful, custom web apps for machine learning and data science. In just a few minutes we can build and deploy powerful data apps.

Check out the library [here](https://streamlit.io/).

You can also look into the [tutorials](https://docs.streamlit.io/en/stable/).

I try to create new applications with Streamlit.
